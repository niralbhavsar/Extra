eCommerce web application similar to craigslist but focused on usability of UI and UX

This group project was a term project for my CSC 640 Software Engineering class at SF State. The following technologies were used to build this project:

HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, Bootstrap3, JavaScript, jQuery, Amazon Web Services, PHP(backend)

This project was geared toward ease of use and user experience. We wanted to take the best things that craigslist/ebay/amazon had to offer and combine those features into one.
